The timer will give you an alert once it is boiled. 

There are three types of eggs we have!
## 1. Soft
## 2. Medium and
## 3. Hard.

Normally the **Soft** egg shall take 5 mintes to get boiled. **Medium** one shall take around 7 Minutes. And the same way **Hard** one will take 12 Minutes. 

Here is the alarm to remain you for fun(LOL)
