Thanks for giving good basement for beginner.  

Simply tried to develope an iOS app 


The timer will give you an alert once it is boiled. 

There is three types of eggs 
## 1. Soft
## 2. Medium and
## 3. Hard.

Normally the **Soft** egg shall take 5 mintes to get boiled. **Medium** one shall take around 7 Minutes. And the same way **Hard** one will take 12 Minutes. 

Here is the alarm to remain you for fun(LOL)
